# The Plan...

Make a very simple website, the code can suck, it already does: it's in typescript


## MOSCOWS

### Must have...

- Mobile compatibility
- Contact page
- Projects list
- Bio
- Dark mode
- Ability to add new projects easily

### Should have

- Search function
- Projects ordered by date
- Nice url
- Images in projects list

### Could have

- Light and dark mode
- Nice animations

### Won't have

- More than 4 main pages

## Structure

- Navbar
    - Compatible with small screens

- Home page 
    - contains bio

- Blog/Projects page 
    - contains any projects in a list ordered by date with a search function

- Contact page
    - Contains email address/contact box

## Limitations and strategy

- Idrk web dev
- For theming it is better to have the 'icons' in typescript to allow easy colour manipulation
- Theming done through tailwind
- Conditional layout
- Static images in /public/assets
